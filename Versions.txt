tf2autobot-upgrade: 1.22
tf2autobot-upgrade-demo: 1.5

Changes:
I don't really remember all the changes but I added more stuff to tokenGroups and I made it so for the premium version you can combine any tokens with &imsure.
I set "alwaysDeclineNonTF2Items" to false by default, it was true by default

Changes for 1.19:
Added !ctbulk and !ctkbulk, they perform the good token operations with one command.

Changes for 1.20:
Copy-pasted some stuff from bliss's fork of tf2autobot, I don't think I've completed it because the bot isn't making listings on pricedb.io

1.21:

Added 
                listings: priceListEntry.listings,
                priority: priceListEntry.priority,
to updateListings.ts

1.22: There's no update, please don't use tf2autobot-upgrade until 1.23, a critical value mismatching was discovered and you don't want to run your bots with that bug.
