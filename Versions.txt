tf2autobot-upgrade: 1.30
tf2autobot-upgrade-demo: 1.5

Changes:
I don't really remember all the changes but I added more stuff to tokenGroups and I made it so for the premium version you can combine any tokens with &imsure.
I set "alwaysDeclineNonTF2Items" to false by default, it was true by default

Changes for 1.19:
Added !ctbulk and !ctkbulk, they perform the good token operations with one command.

Changes for 1.20:
Copy-pasted some stuff from bliss's fork of tf2autobot, I don't think I've completed it because the bot isn't making listings on pricedb.io

1.21:

Added 
                listings: priceListEntry.listings,
                priority: priceListEntry.priority,
to updateListings.ts

1.22: There's no update, please don't use tf2autobot-upgrade until 1.23, a critical value mismatching was discovered and you don't want to run your bots with that bug.
If you read this, change the version number from 1.21 to 1.22 in Bot.ts to stop getting notifications and turn off the buy or sell commands in options, then you can use this without the bug

1.23:
Fixed that critical value mismatch bug. I haven't tested it a lot yet but it should work now since I have tested it at least once and it worked, so you can turn on buy/sell commands again
If you're curious about what it was
Say you have no metal, the bot you're trading with does and you send a command to buy a quick-fix for 0.22 ref
This would happen:
⌛ Please wait while I process your offer! You will be offered a Quick-Fix and 0.22 ref for 0 keys, 0 ref.

It happens the other way around too (it was discovered this way actually, a bot tried to take a quick-fix and 0.22 ref for nothing or something like that)
Bugs:
In PolishUserCart it said this:
        if (this.bot.inventoryManager.amountCanAfford(true, currencies, buyerInventory, []) < 1) {
I changed it to this:
        if (this.bot.inventoryManager.amountCanAfford(true, currencies, buyerInventory, [], isBuyer, sellKeyPrice.metal, buyKeyPrice.metal) < 1) {

In amountCanAfford itself it said const value = isBuyer ? buyKey : sellKey; which is a big mistake, it's supposed to be:
        const keyRate = isBuyer ? buyKey : sellKey;
        const value = price.toValue(keyRate);


I think it works now, I've been working for many hours on this. Hopefully all catastrophic errors are gone.
