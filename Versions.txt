tf2autobot-upgrade: 1.19
tf2autobot-upgrade-demo: 1.5

Changes:
I don't really remember all the changes but I added more stuff to tokenGroups and I made it so for the premium version you can combine any tokens with &imsure.
I set "alwaysDeclineNonTF2Items" to false by default, it was true by default

Changes for 1.19:
Added !ctbulk and !ctkbulk, they perform the good token operations with one command.
