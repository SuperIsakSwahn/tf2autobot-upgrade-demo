Assuming you already have tf2autobot setup, drag the src folder in there, replace all files that this will, then build your bot's dist folder (such as the tsc command)
There are shortcuts to items
If you type !w 1 then you withdraw all vaccinators and quick-fixes for example, check Commands.ts for more details (tokenGroups)
Basic killstreak weapons fallback to 6 ref, vaccinators 1 ref, festivized items 5 ref etc, check MyHandler for exact lists.
Don't remove the file without an extension that is just a number in the files\botname\ folder, it represents how many festivizers it bought.
